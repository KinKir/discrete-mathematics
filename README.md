This repository contains the coursework for Discrete Mathematics (CSCI 246) at Montana State University.

The course work consisted of 12 homework assignments where I was asked to perform basic proof techniques.
This was my first attempt at proofs, for an updated view of how I write proofs, view the repository topology.

Note: The file homework_template.tex and the directory csci-246-fall2018
are not my work. They were provided by the instructor for the course
Dr. Brittany Fasy
