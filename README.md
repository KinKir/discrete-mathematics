This repository contains the coursework for Discrete Mathematics (CSCI 246) at Montana State University.

The course work consisted of 12 homework assignments where I was asked to perform basic proof techniques.
This was my first attempt at proofs, for an updated view of how I write proofs, view the repository topology.
